    <h1>Imagine a place...</h1>
    <p>
        <h5>...where you can belong to a school club, a gaming group, or a worldwide art community. Where just you and a handful of
        friends can spend time together. A place that makes it easy to talk every day and hang out more often.</h5>
    </p>


    <h2>Create an invite-only place where you belong</h2>
    <p>
        Discord servers are organized into topic-based channels where you can collaborate, share, and just talk about your day without clogging up a group chat.
    </p>


    <h2>Where hanging out is easy</h2>
    <p>
        Grab a seat in a voice channel when you're free. Friends in your server can see you're around and instantly pop in to talk without having to call.
    </p>


    <h2>From few to a fandom</h2>
    <p>
        Get any community running with moderation tools and custom member access. Give members special powers, set up private channels, and more.
    </p>

    
    <h2>Reliable tech for staying close</h2>
    <p>
        Low-latency voice and video feels like you're in the same room. Wave hello over video, watch friends stream their games, or gather up and have a drawing session with screen share.
